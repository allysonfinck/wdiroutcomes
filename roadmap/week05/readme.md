# A Day in the Life… Studio Tour 

## Framing: 
Ever wonder what it’s actually like to work in the field? Now’s your chance to get a behind-the-scenes look at the day to day of an office. Ask current employees questions, see the office environment, and get a personalized tour. We’ve set up an organization to walk you through their space.

Come with 3 questions for our presenters. This will include a tour of the space and time for a brief presentation from the organization and Q+A. 

Don’t forget to connect with all speakers on LinkedIn and thank them for their time! 

## Learning Objectives: 
To get a better understanding of what it’s like to work in a web development organization and how students may envision themselves working there -- what a ""day in the life"" could potentially look like. 

With our studio this week, you will:
- Observe a developer work environment.
- Understand what it’s like to work with a variety of clients.
- Learn what a ""day in the life"" of a developer looks like.
 
**Themes:** Understanding the Landscape
