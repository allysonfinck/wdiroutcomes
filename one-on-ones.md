# Meeting One-on-One with your Outcomes Coach

I love meeting and talking with you, please don't be shy! 

One-on-Ones are a safe space to talk about literally anything. One-on-Ones might include:
- Your previous work history 
- Goals for your future 
- Creating your job search strategy 
- Getting you past roadblocks 
- Follow up or networking strategies 
- Feedback on your materials 
- Emotional issues

**It's up to you** what gets covered during the one-on-ones, so please come with questions prepared and be on time! I also ask that you let me know if you have to cancel your time slot, either via email or Slack.
